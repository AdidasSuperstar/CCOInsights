# Overview

As part of the Continuous Cloud Optimization Insights solution, a dashboard is included to track the contributions made to a Azure DevOps repository. The objective is to monitor not only the cloud environment, but also all the resources used for its design, deployment and maintenance. This dashboard allows you to monitor different metrics such as:
- Number of Projects and branches
- Pull requests
  - Average pull requests per day
  - Comparison between number of open vs closed pull requests over the last months
- Comparison between number of lines added vs deleted per month
- Top contributors measured by changes in their pull requests.
- Branches created over the last months

An important note about this dashboard is that **this dashboard can be published in the PowerBI online service with auto refresh enabled**. The difference with the current versions of the other dashboards of CCO Insights is that, for this one, no dynamic queries are being done directly from the PowerBI file, meaning that it can be published and consumed directly from the [PowerBI online][PublishPowerBI] service.
